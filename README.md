# INTRODUCTION

This repository is dedicated to all my SAS - Statistical Analysis Software projects. Each project folder within this repository has its on README.md file that briefly describes about the project, a PDF file that lets you visualize the project without you having to download the file to view it, a pptx file for anyone interested to download the file and lastly a code file which displays the codes and associated comments. Feel free to reach out for any questions.

Thank You,
